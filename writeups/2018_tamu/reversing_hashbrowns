# Error
./hashbrowns.dms: error while loading shared libraries: libcrypto.so.1.0.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
# Solution
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev:i386

# When running the program, the output is:
# "mypassword" is the input
 please enter the password 
 the password is 20 characters or less 
mypassword
input string mypassword
after afe796528c5f8c4518fd96327a7d07f
invalid password

# the after hash changes after every run with the same input
# the hash does not change if running in gdb

# It's probably doing a md5 hash of sort based on the function called 
# "md5string" and the comparison to "8819d19069fae6b4bac183d1f16553abab16b54f"

# After reversing md5string, found out that it's doing a md5 on the first 
# character of the input string and some junk data which is probably causing it
# to get a different hash everytime.

# There really was no need to reverse because we can just use an online tool
# to break the hash that it's comparing it to. Which was actually a sha1 hash.
# There was no need to put in so much effort...
